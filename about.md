## About Us

At Beckman Science Olympiad, our goal is to foster a deep passion for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) within our school community.

We strive to cultivate critical thinking, teamwork, and innovation through rigorous academic challenges and hands-on competitions. Our mission is to inspire the next generation of thinkers, creators, and leaders.
